	in html and css if you use '/' for locating the file it represents the htdocs(working space), but php runs in the backend server ,so we should use __DIR__
	but the above mention method, __DIR__ is a not consistent method
	
	then wich is consistent??

	1. copy the http request from the browser
	2. open and connect the telnet
		in cli
		telent localhost 80 or telent ip_address 80
	3. paste the copied content (http request)	
		press enter 2 times

	try the request with GET and then try with POST
	GET & POST => are the popular HTTP request methods

	TYPES OF HTTP METHODS
		GET

// How to call the function effectively & consistent manner

	function load_template($name){
		include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."<location>".php; //used in every server & it is consistent in nature
		//we can use include_once also
		//Example : "/<app_name>/<foder_name>/$name.php"
	}

/*
	$_SERVER is the super global , which makes the link b/w php & apache

	To learn more about , URL and http(s) methods, working principle , install post man app and do a experiment with that.

	in URL, we see ?id=2&cid=234
	these are things of information going by means of array of _GET

	so, _GET is not recommended to sending username and userpassword
	then, what is the another method to sending them?
		if i use _POST , i can send the contents of info in the both way , url and _post has separate space for it called body, so developer can choose by which 		was he wants to send their data's.

		to send the data to the _POST,
		we use, form-data or form-encoded-data(not able send files)

		_GET => only URL
		_POST => both URL & body

		_COOKIE => isolated storage , to store the info , it will sent to server , what irrespective of the HTTP(s) method.
		it is persistent storage, we can able to expiry time of the cookie
		_COOKIE are not sharable among websites, these was done by, browser
		where to see the cookies in browser?
			in inspect element, goto storage , goto to cookies => here we can see n number of cookies
		
		cookies are session related things,
		cookie hijacking is done by XSS => Cross Site Scripting

		if you open any wesbite, it will ask permission for store cookies,
		why , cookies are store inside our own computer thats why they ask permission
		
		remember me option in browser is posible because of cookies.

		Oauth => open authentication
			login into website by other website's info
		Socialauth => Social authentication
			login into the website via the browser, you are already logged in

///////////LOGIN PAGE////////////////////////////////////////

$_GET is used to fetch the data
$_POST is used to send the data securely through body

GET is for fetching data, appending parameters in the URL, ideal for searches.
POST, used for updates, sends data securely in the request body, perfect for forms

form action="<webpage>" method="get/post"

if you use get & post , we should use "name" in input , otherwise the content you typed in form will not send to action page
this is the name which is array index in PHP


/////////////////////////////////////////////SIGN UP PAGE////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
TO LOAD THE CSS PAGE DYNAMICALLY BY THE SERVER

PHP_SELF => It is the variable it has the location file name which was executing current

basefunction , it is an built-in function used to extract the filename from the given path
Example: S:/csbs/test.txt
	basename(S:/csbs/test.txt)         //output => test.txt
we want only the name of the file so, give the .txt as the second parameter to the basename
	basename(S:/csbs/test.txt,".txt")    //output =>test

<link href="/app/css/<?=basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'],'.php')?>.css"

file_exists , built-in function used to check whether the file is exist or not, for this we should provide a location of file
it helps to load the file only it was present

<?if(file_exists($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/app/css'/.basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'],".php").".css")?>


isset($_POST['username']);
isset is the inbuilt function used to excecute the code only it was set,which means only it is present

$index = array_search(needle,sea);
array_search is the inbuilt function used to find the index of the needle in the sea
if the needle is not found in the sea, it will return false

array_key_search(needle,sea);
used to find the keys is present or not

gettype()
gettype is the inbuilt function used to get the type of the variable

count()
count is the inbuilt function used to get the size of the array

//Integer and Strings are only be the keys of the assosicative array
array_flip() //used to flip the key and values


callback //means we need to pass the function there

array_chunk($array,no);
split the 1D array into 2D array , keys are removed
//to preserve keys add another parameter "true"
array_chunk($array,no,true);

array_pad($array,size,WhatToFill);//WhatToFill=>anything,int,string,array,object....
size=+ve right side
size=-ve left side
